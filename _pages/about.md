Welcome to my homepage! (Last edited in Feb. 2024)

I am Yanzhe Wang (王彦喆), a junior student from [School of Mathematical Science](https://math.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://pku.edu.cn), major in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics.

I have a wide range of interests in Machine Learning and Quantitative Finance. Previously, I have interned as a quantitative researcher at Tongdeng Capital and Lianhai Capital, and will be joining Jane Street as a quantitative trader intern in the upcoming summer of 2024. 

I have conducted research on high-frequency pricing models under the guidance of Prof. Ruixun Zhang, and have conducted empirical research on the volatility of options in the Chinese market under the guidance of Prof. Alan Anderson from NYU.

I am a super Pokémon fan! Check out [Pokémon](https://iceleafzzz.github.io/pokemon) for more information!
