Welcome to my homepage! (Last edited in May. 2025)

I am Yanzhe Wang (王彦喆), a senior student from [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://pku.edu.cn), major in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. I am also an incoming Master student at Princeton University for a one-year MFin program.

I have a wide range of interests in Machine Learning and Quantitative Finance. Previously, I have interned as a quant researcher at Tongdeng Capital in 2024 winter, and as a quant trader at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com) in Hong Kong last summer. I will do a return internship at Jane Street in 2025 summer and join as a full time trader in 2026 summer after the graduation of my Master degree.

I have conducted several research programs, including researches on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Trading Platform under the guidance of Prof. Yangbo He, on High-Frequency Pricing Models under the guidance of Prof. Ruixun Zhang. I also have conducted empirical research on the Volatility of Options in the Chinese Market under the guidance of Prof. Alan Anderson from NYU. Recently, I have worked on Discrete Diffusion Models under the guidance of Prof. Mengdi Wang from Princeton University and Prof. Minshuo Chen from Northwestern University.

I am a super fan of Pokémon! Check out [Pokémon](https://iceleafzzz.github.io/pokemon) for more information!
