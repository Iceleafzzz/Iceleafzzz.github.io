Welcome to my homepage! (Last edited in Sep. 2024)

I am Yanzhe Wang (王彦喆), a senior student from [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://pku.edu.cn), major in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics.

I have a wide range of interests in Machine Learning and Quantitative Finance. Previously, I have interned as a quant researcher at Tongdeng Capital in 2024 winter, and as a quant trader at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com) in Hong Kong last summer. I will join Jane Street as a full time trader in 2025 summer after graduation.

I have conducted research on high-frequency pricing models under the guidance of Prof. Ruixun Zhang, and have conducted empirical research on the volatility of options in the Chinese market under the guidance of Prof. Alan Anderson from NYU. Currently, I am working on discrete diffusion models under the guidance of Prof. Mengdi Wang from Princeton University and Prof. Minshuo Chen from Northwestern University.

I am a super fan of Pokémon! Check out [Pokémon](https://iceleafzzz.github.io/pokemon) for more information!
